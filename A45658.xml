            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <hi>Man at firſt was a very excellent and deſirable Creature.</hi> This the Point; and this is no more then Scripture reports of him. Where mention is made of his firſt eſtate, <hi>David</hi> brings him in with a crown upon his head, and that crown is a crown of glory and honour. <hi>Thou haſt crowned him with glory and honour, Pſal.</hi> 8.5. His place was little lower then Angells, but far above all other Creatures: As <hi>Job</hi> affirmes, <hi>Job.</hi> 35. <hi>v.</hi> 11. God made him wiſer then the beaſts of the earth, then the fowles of heaven. Yea, the Prophet aſſures us that the worſt piece of him, the very caſe and outſide, was moſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly wrought and richly embroydered, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.15. <hi>Moſes</hi> goes yet higher, and carryes us above creatures to Gods bleſſed ſelf, <hi>Let us make man,</hi> faith God, This Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>in our image</hi> and after our likeneſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. Thus in Generalls we have him ſet forth to us. For Particulars, I ſhall not trouble you with any large diſcourſe touching his excellencies, either of ſoul, or body, or eſtate: Neither can we in this our decayed condition reach them. We ſee, we feel what he is; but what he either was or ſhall be, we can rather gueſs then judge, as blind men do of colours; onely this we are ſure of, within there was nothing but what was deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; without, nothing but what was amiable; about him, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what was ſerviceable and comfortable: his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding was as full of light as it was free from darkneſſe;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102349:11"/>his judgement, ſound; his conſcience, clear; his will, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Gods will; his affections, regular; nothing on that ſide wanting to his preſent happineſſe. Or if we look without him, 1. His body had nothing of blemiſh or bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or diſtemper; but rather cloathed with all requiſite beauties and abilityes, which might render him lovely, and commend him to every eye. 2. For his eſtate, what it was before his fall we may gueſſe by that which is ſince reſtored by Chriſt, whereof we have a touch in that 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pſalme: to wit; God gave him a Soverainty over all the creatures, and ſtampt ſuch a majeſty upon him, that they did all acknowledge him, and received their ſeverall names, as ſo many acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements from him. As for his poſſeſſions, we need not ſtand to enlarge upon one Parcell of his Deſmeans, which they call Paradiſe, ſith the whole, both of ſea and land, and all the creatures in both, were then his poſſeſſion, his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. Thus the caſe ſtood with man at firſt, the creatures were as obſervant of him as he of his Creator. More then this I ſhall not ſpeak in theſe particulars. This being a Theam ſo much treated of by Schoolmen and others, who write of this firſt eſtate.<note place="margin">Cleared in his ſeverall cauſes.</note> The whole matter will be further cleared if welook upon man in his cauſes.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider the <hi>Efficient cauſe,</hi> or the Author of man, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it's God himſelf: <hi>Adam,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luke,</hi> was the ſon of God, thence he derives his Pedegree. Now from the excellency of the <hi>cauſe,</hi> it is not hard to infer the excellency of the <hi>effect,</hi> eſpecially ſince <hi>efficients</hi> work by way of <hi>aſſimilation;</hi> Naturall efficients. neceſſarily; voluntary cauſes, freely: both ſtrive to accompliſh their own works to their own ends and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; now God (a voluntary agent) is all light, and works like himſelf, ſo that from him can come no darkneſſe; he is all goodneſſe, all perfection, and can do nothing but what is in its kind good and perfect: nay further, God is not <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> to be conſidered in this work, but with <hi>relation</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality. The three glorious Perſons concur in this exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall work: whence that expreſſion <hi>Job</hi> 35.10.<note place="margin">Eſ. 54.5. Pſ. 149.2.</note>

In <hi>perfection</hi> of power: he created him, without the contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of either matter or inſtrument, and ſo became the <hi>ſole</hi> and <hi>whole</hi> cauſe of man.</p>

At firſt, of all viſible creatures <hi>man</hi> came neareſt to God. But wherein? not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his <hi>nature;</hi> becauſe he had an underſtanding, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable will, a working immortall ſpirit in him, as Papiſts, and others ſpeak; nor yet onely in order to his <hi>eſtate,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102349:12"/>hee was made Lord over all creatures, as <hi>Socinians</hi> would have it; But alſo and ſpecially in regard of his <hi>Graces and endowments</hi> ſeated in his ſoul: God made him wiſe, holy, juſt, upright, wherein the Apoſtle chiefly placeth Gods Image; and that moſt juſtly, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. That being the chiefe of Gods image in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> which Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> doth moſtly repair and reſtore. When then it is ſaid, that <hi>God made man like himſelf,</hi> the meaning is, <hi>he made him holy,</hi> righteous, ſpirituall, according <hi>to the ſampler,</hi> Gods bleſſed ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Conſider the <hi>Finall cauſe;</hi> God made man for <hi>moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi>

Nor can any man ſtrange at this, ſith it is the practiſe of all wiſe agents: Every skilfull workman (you know) layes out moſt of his skill and coſt upon that piece which he intends for higheſt uſe and credit, as every builder is more exact in ſetting out a <hi>chimney piece,</hi> then in making a <hi>gutter.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Yet, ſecondly, the argument holds not, unleſſe we did place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the whole of Gods Image <hi>onely</hi> in holineſſe. There indeed we lay it <hi>chiefly,</hi> but not <hi>onely.</hi> We ſay that Gods Image is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the whole <hi>compoſitum</hi> or Man. We put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the body of a <hi>man,</hi> and the body of a <hi>beaſt,</hi> whether <hi>living or dying:</hi> wee yeeld that a dead man hath more of God in his body, then a dead beaſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and in ſhort, to cut off theſe diſputes, wee ſay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> two things; firſt that there be <hi>degrees</hi> of holineſſe in this Image of God; and next, that it is not <hi>neceſſary</hi> that man ſhould partake with God in <hi>all</hi> his attributes, whereof ſome are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable; much leſſe that hee ſhould <hi>equalize</hi> God, though in ſome meaſure he be a <hi>repreſentative</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>To the former I adde this fourth principle. The diſtance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is very great between man <hi>now,</hi> and man at the <hi>firſt,</hi> as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> here puts it: as man was changeable then, ſo now he is changed very much; though ſome ruines and remnants of that which they call the <hi>ſubſtantiall Image</hi> abide upon him. This you muſt the rather be ſetled in, becauſe Hereticks labour tooth and nayle, to confound theſe different ſtates. Thus Papiſts ſweat to prove that man in his pure naturals is as good <hi>now</hi> as <hi>then:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Againſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</note> and the <hi>ſame</hi> then that he is <hi>now,</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering no more, at leaſt for <hi>intrinſccals,</hi> then a man <hi>cloathed,</hi> and <hi>uncloathed</hi> differs from himſelf; or, then a horſe bridled and unbridled. The caſe was this, God put a bridle of <hi>ſuperve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient righteouſneſſe</hi> upon him to rein him in; other wiſe hee had the <hi>ſame ſeeds</hi> and principles of corruption, conflict, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence <hi>then,</hi> that he hath <hi>now.</hi>

                     <p>Let them go. And hold we this <hi>diſtance</hi> ſtill: man is not ſo bad now, but once he was as good.

This the Point, and this the word plainly proves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> here are layd down two received truths. 1. <hi>There's no goodneſſe in any.</hi> 2. They are <hi>altogether naught;</hi> But was it ever thus? No, <hi>they have gone out of the way,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>they have corrupted themſelves,</hi> and that <hi>from their youth, Gen.</hi> 8.21. They <hi>erre,</hi> and that from <hi>the wombe, Pſal.</hi> 58.3. Yea, from <hi>their conception, Pſal.</hi> 51.5. This better appears, if we may compare eſtates paſt and preſent: 1.

And at this we can the leſſe marvell, ſince his beginning, he comes under different hands; At firſt he was onely Gods workmanſhip, and then there was nothing in him but what was Gods, all was right as God is altogether pure: but ſince, he hath deſerted God and betaken himſelf to thoſe Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which himſelf hath hatch'd and Satan fomented, and hereby wrought two miſchiefs at once. Firſt, he hath made
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102349:17"/>an hand of all his holineſſe. Secondly, he hath made way to all evill, ſin, horrour, ſhame, confuſion, have ſeiſed upon all and rendered him moſt woefull, moſt hatefull; we need not more words to prove a change in him. Their dreams of old who fancied him to be bad from the beginning, either in whole or part, are not worth confutation, we have learned that the devils themſelves were once good, but they kept not their ſtation. Time will be better ſpent in ſearching into the Particulars of this change, as into the <hi>time</hi> when it was, the <hi>nature</hi> of it, the <hi>ſubject</hi> and <hi>extent</hi> of it, <hi>the cauſe of it, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">1. Time of this change.</note> And firſt for the <hi>time;</hi> we conclude all in two propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>firſt act</hi> of mans will after his creation, was not <hi>the firſt ſin</hi> and <hi>cauſe</hi> of this his <hi>change;</hi> we find <hi>Adam</hi> a while <hi>well</hi> employed, in receiving laws from his maker, in marking as it were, his cattle, in acting his calling, in accepting his Fathers choice of a wife, and thus far he was right. Nor are arguments of ſome <hi>Thomiſts</hi> againſt this, ſo cogent, that they need to ſtay us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It's moſt reaſonable to think that he <hi>quickly fell,</hi> (though not <hi>ſo ſoon</hi>) from his happy eſtate, becauſe Satan was very ſubtill to take him at the advantage, before he was well ſetled, and experienced; and ſecondly, very active, fired with rage and envy. Becauſe he is ſaid to be a <hi>murderer from the beginning;</hi> or very near to it; which beginning muſt commence from man, not from himſelf. Adde hereunto, that he had not ſo eaſily prevailed, if man had been <hi>long</hi> rooted, and ſo better enabled to have made ſtronger reſiſtance; (for I make no doubt but <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have <hi>growen</hi> and emproved himſelf by experience, as ſome wayes the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> did) but he took his time, whileſt <hi>yet</hi> they were unexperienced, as is ſeen chiefly in <hi>Eve,</hi> who as yet knew not, as it ſeems, the nature of the Serpent: whereto we may adde this, that ſhe, the ſame <hi>Eve,</hi> had <hi>conceived her firſt born without ſin,</hi> had <hi>any conſiderable time been 'twixt their creation and fall.</hi> But I will not be too peremptory in things more diſputable and leſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant.</p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:102349:17"/>
                     <p> For the ſecond,<note place="margin">2. Nature of this change. 1. Negatively.</note> the <hi>nature</hi> of this change. Thus we ſtate it. Firſt, the change was not in <hi>Eſſentials,</hi> for ſuch cannot be ſeparated from the thing, without its diſſolution: but man was for <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> the ſame man before and after his change: Chriſt was eſſentially man, though far from ſin. So ſhall we be in heaven. Therefore if this were the errour of <hi>Illyricus,</hi> it were an errour ſufficiently groſs. We read, that God made <hi>ſubſtances,</hi> he made no <hi>ſins.</hi> Secondly, it was not in <hi>Supernaturals</hi> onely, for <hi>naturals</hi> alſo are abated and eclipſed in him, neither was his <hi>Originall righteouſneſs</hi> altogether ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall at that time; we may call that (properly enough) <hi>naturall</hi> which is common to the <hi>whole ſpecies,</hi> to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and paſſeth along in a way of generation, though we cannot expreſſe how. But then the objection is, If righteouſneſſe be any way naturall, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                        </label> then that ceaſing, man ſhould alſo ceaſe to be man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> The argument will not follow,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> becauſe <hi>naturals</hi> do admit of <hi>degrees:</hi> ſight is naturall, ſpeech naturall, &amp;c. yet a blind or dumbe man, is yet a man; we may ſafely ſay, that righteouſneſſe was as naturall, as ſin is preternaturall: and we mean no more but that Juſtice was then as naturall, as now ſin is. Sin is either naturall or preternaturall, (if you will ſo call it:) we ſpeak of man in this caſe <hi>Morally</hi> not <hi>Phyſically</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and heed not what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> will call him, but what God ſaith of him. This for the negative.</p>
                     <p>Now poſitively,<note place="margin">2. Poſitively.</note> we ſay that this change is properly an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, conſiſting in <hi>Qualities</hi> and cetain reſpects. Whereas man held a double correſpondency with God, one <hi>Relative,</hi> as he ſtood in ſubjection to him, and a dependence upon him, as his maker, maſter, father, &amp;c. Another <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative,</hi> as he bare Gods Image, which he could not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beare in a relation of Inferiority: he is now much varied and changed, in both theſe. Firſt, of a <hi>ſubject,</hi> he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>rebell,</hi> of a ſon a traytour, of a friend an enemy, and ſtands now at defiance with God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, whereas he earſt much <hi>favoured</hi> and reſembled God, now he is moſt <hi>removed</hi> from him, and oppoſite to him,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102349:18"/>of light he is become darkneſſe, as <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it in the abſtract: Semblably, we may ſay of wiſdome he is become folly, of goodneſſe, in a ſenſe, ſin it ſelf, as the very Heathens uſe to expreſſe him. And here is the change, in a mans eſtate both perſonall and locall. Subjection is turned into Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Conformity into Difformity, and ſo into Deformity, and conſequently, his happineſſe into unhappineſſe it ſelf. Thus for the ſecond Queſtion. Followes the third touching the <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Extent</hi> of this change: and this we diſpatch in three words.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">3. Extent of this change.</note> 
                        <hi>all</hi> mankind is changed for the <hi>worſe,</hi> and is warped aſide.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, all <hi>of</hi> man, every particular both <hi>power</hi> and <hi>part,</hi> is now degenerated; The whole frame of his heart is corrupted. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, <hi>all men,</hi> all alike, all involved, and ſuffer this unhappy change.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of this change.<note place="margin">4. The cauſe of it.</note> Firſt, we exclude not God from any act, though from all ſin.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we excuſe not Satan from the ſin, though from ſome acts in it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we lay the blame where the fault is, upon mans ſelf. To inlarge theſe a little.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, we exclude nor a divine concurrence; Gods decree, permiſſive (as ſome ſpeak) went upon it; and this, to ſay the leaſt, we muſt needs ſay, unleſſe we will ſay that God ſtood <hi>Neutrall</hi> in one of the <hi>higheſt</hi> works of providence, neither willing nor nilling it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Satan did ſo far concur as to bring a guilt upon himſelf, by tempting man. But the Word chargeth the ſin upon mans ſelf, they have <hi>ſought out,</hi> ſo ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi> ſo muſt we ſay. Though man would ſhift it from himſelf, and divide it betwixt God and Satan. But 'tis found upon him, and there we muſt leave it.</p>
                     <p>But how could this be (will ſome ſay) how could man ſo accompliſh it, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>

                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:102349:18"/>
                     <p> Firſt, that man was made out of <hi>Nothing,</hi> and therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> apt enough to return into his firſt principles, and more prone to <hi>privations,</hi> ſuch as ſin is, then to <hi>poſitive</hi> goods, when he is left to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he is a <hi>compounded</hi> creature, and therefore in and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of himſelf <hi>mutable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, he is a <hi>finite</hi> creature, and borrows all from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and of himſelf is ſubject to <hi>deficiencies,</hi> and ſo may ſin.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, he is a creature ſo <hi>bounded</hi> that he cannot ſee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and do, and conſider all things at once, and ſo may fall into <hi>diverſions</hi> and excogitancies.</p>
                     <p>I, and Fiftly, he is a <hi>free</hi> creature, and therefore may <hi>act</hi> or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                        <hi>ſuſpend,</hi> uſe or not uſe, his abilities at pleaſure. But, it were better happily, leaving theſe diſputes, to look up to God and admire with <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that things ſhould be <hi>againſt</hi> his will, and yet not altogether <hi>beſides</hi> it; and to bethink our ſelves how we may <hi>riſe,</hi> rather then how we did <hi>fall.</hi> It ſufficeth for the preſent, that we clear God as much as Papiſts or any others: at leaſt we deſire to do it; and if they can teach us how to ſpeak better, and more for the vindication of Gods holineſſe, we ſhall thank them, mean while we mean as well as they, and ſpeak as much for the vindication of Gods holineſſe as any <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or <hi>Arminius</hi> of them all; we ſay, that God is no <hi>morall</hi> cauſe of ſin, and <hi>Phyſical cauſe</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be: ſin having only a cauſe <hi>deficient,</hi> but none <hi>efficient;</hi> we do not ſay that any precedent decree doth force the will or compell the man. Nor on the other ſide, do we ſay that the whole work of ſin is only from man, nothing of it from Satan (as he reports, who uſually is more modeſt): but this we do,<note place="margin">Eſtius lib. <hi>2.</hi> diſtinct. <hi>21.</hi> Sect. <hi>11.</hi> &amp; diſtinct. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> we ſet the ſaddle on the right horſe, and ſay as <hi>Salomon</hi> guides us, Man hath ſought out many inventions. Do you underſtand what I have ſaid, or ſhall I ſpeak it yet more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? we yeeld a <hi>concurrence</hi> of <hi>many agents</hi> in mans change, but with a wide difference, as to the manner of their working.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for God; we muſt not conceive him to be only a <hi>ſpectator,</hi> in this high work of providence, we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his <hi>diſpoſing</hi> hand, his <hi>ordering</hi> hand, his <hi>decreeing</hi> hand,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102349:19"/>in leaving man to his own choice: but ſtill without the leaſt ſhadow of ſin. Secondly, for Satan; we muſt not excuſe him whom God curſeth, he was certainly a <hi>morall</hi> cauſe of mans ſin, and did his utmoſt to perſwade.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, for Mans ſelf; we muſt ſpeak <hi>Salomons</hi> language, who lays not the fault upon the devill, as no reaſon he ſhould: for a moral cauſe hath no influence, at leaſt no inforcing power upon the ſubject. Much leſſe doth he lay it upon God, who always ſeriouſly diſſwades <hi>from</hi> ſin, Phyſically infuſeth no ill, nor withholds requiſite ſtrength. 'Tis true, fleſh and blond will cavill and find this baſtard ſinne many fathers: but man is father and mother both, himſelf: ſo the Word ſpeaks it, and <hi>Adam</hi> with all his skill could not ſhift it off from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though never ſo willing. I ſay in this caſe, as one ſaid in another; In one and the ſame thing many cauſes may concurre, but not to the ſame end, nor in the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>Now this makes firſt for our information. <label type="milestone">

                        <note place="margin">Ever obſerve this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a good and bad eſtate.</note> God, you ſee here, teacheth us a double eſtate; learn we both: God ſets a bound and diſtinction: thus farre goes his work; here begins ours: Now we muſt keep aſunder what he ſo diſtinctly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the rather becauſe a confuſion here is in it ſelf moſt hurtfull, and by many moſt induſtriouſly endevoured: Oh how do wits ſweat to trouble theſe waters! to this end, that we ſhould not ſee our own faces, nor diſcern which is which. Hence thoſe uncouth concluſions in both eſtates. In the firſt, <hi>There is no ſuch thing as Original Righteouſnes,</hi> no ſuch Image of God as we fancy, ſay the <hi>Socinians;</hi> Next, <hi>there is ſuch a thing,</hi> ſay Papiſts, <hi>but it was not natural;</hi> it was to man but as cloathes and trappings to the body, as if man ſhould not have been born in this ſpirituall armour, as ſome ſpake of Giants for other armour; but come into the world as naked of Grace, as a horſe doth of a Saddle, &amp;c. till God from without do furniſh him.

Now what ſtronger proof of our declenſion? what a miſerable thing is man become! who rather then he will be beholding to God for his firſt ſetting up, or to Chriſt for his ſupplyed repaires and recruits; rather then he will acknowledge himſelf ſuch a fool, ſuch a beaſt to part with ſo faire an eſtate, cares not what he ſaith, or reports, as to Gods work or his own in either eſtate. Oh madneſs! were it not fit for us to ſay with <hi>Salomon,</hi> God made man upright, but <hi>man</hi> hath undone himſelf? Surely this were fit: but then thinks proud fleſh, what will become of free will? what of merit? what of fulfilling the Law? what of all fleſhly boaſting and excellency? were this granted, then muſt God be juſtified; then muſt man be abaſed. But rather then God ſhall goe away with all the credit, and man with all the ſhame, he will mingle heaven and earth, light and darkneſſe, and come to this, either hee was <hi>never</hi> good, and that reflects upon God; or elſe is good ſtill, and then mought Chriſt have <hi>ſaved</hi> a labour; at leaſt, <hi>much</hi> of his blond, if the Frier be right, who ſaith,<note place="margin">Fevardent.</note> that one ſcar of Chriſt could have redeemed all. Good my brethren, admit of light, of truths ſo fundamentall; know a <hi>change,</hi> acknowledge what it is, whence it is: It is from light to darkneſſe, from life to death, from wiſdome to folly, from heaven to hell, from God to Satan. It is an <hi>univerſall apoſtaſie,</hi> and it is <hi>from your ſelves,</hi> you were <hi>Adam,</hi> as the Text here tels you, legally, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, you can blame none but your ſelves, and none could change you, til your wils or minds did change.

                     <p>Firſt, man of good is become bad, what's the cauſe? he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> gave up God, and fell to his own wits.</p>

He keeps off from God, and beats our himſelf, with his own inventions. So then view him either in the <hi>entrance</hi> of his unhappineſſe, or in the <hi>progreſſe,</hi> or in the <hi>cloſe</hi> of it. <hi>All</hi> is hence, that he goes out from God, and ſtands out to the laſt. His <hi>turning</hi> from God began his miſery, his not <hi>returning</hi> to God perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuates it. No wonder, if it be mans caſe now; it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all creatures, they all ſtand by a manutention. The ſtrongeſt fall, if left to themſelves; as wee ſee not onely in <hi>Adam,</hi> but in the Devils themſelves. Nay, we find it in man now ſomewhat healed and regenerated. Though he hath an immortall principle in him, and a better guard about him, then ever he had, yet ſtands he no longer, then he holds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon God: let him once ſtep out from him, and ſtand High-lone; down he comes, and falls as ſoon into a Guz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel, as into another place.

                           <p>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, &amp;c.—</p>

                     <p>WE have look'd upon man in a double eſtate: we have ſeen what he was in <hi>Gods</hi> hand, what in his <hi>own.</hi> Now we are to enquire what he is in <hi>Chriſts:</hi> Theſe words will give us a generall hint thereof. Where Three things muſt be done, (if we do well.) Firſt, the order; Secondly, the meaning; Thirdly, the uſe of the words muſt be found out. For the firſt, they come in by way of Inference, that's confeſsd. But whence they are inferr'd, is the queſtion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Order of the words.</note> I remember, knits them to the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, eſpecially to thoſe words. <hi>[Not I, but ſin, &amp;c.]</hi> And his conceit is this. There the Apoſtle had proved luſt, i. e. <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidencies and dregges of Originall ſin,</hi> to be no ſin, and here he concludes, Therefore there is no matter of condemnation in Saints. But this cannot ſtand. For, <hi>firſt,</hi> the concluſion is too wide for the premiſes, if they were true; ſince other ſins may damne, though Originall ſin did not. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Premiſes and ground are not true. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay, That concupiſcence and the reliques of originall corruption are no ſins; he ſaith the contrary, over and over in that Chapter, in ſo much as <hi>Arminius</hi> cannot beleeve, that what he ſaith, can
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102349:39"/>agree with a ſanctified eſtate. As for that verſe, <hi>[not I, &amp;c.]</hi> the Apoſtle doth not diſpute, whether there be ſin or no in him, that he yeeldeth, but from what principle that ſin comes; from a principle of fleſh, not of grace. Let's ſet by this then. <hi>Ames</hi> knits theſe words to the fifth Chapter. Others to the ſeventh. <hi>Others,</hi> beſt of all, as I conceive, to the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe foregoing. The Apoſtle having proved our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by grace, or faith, or Chriſt, which upon the matter come all to one, and taken off ſome objections, and abſurdities in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapters, which might at firſt ſight ſeem thence to flow, be now like a good Artiſt ſums up and infers the main concluſion; as if he had ſaid. Now then ſince 'tis cleared that Chriſt is a root as well as <hi>Adam,</hi> and as full of life as he was of death, and puts forth this life effectually to free us from all manner of deaths, it hence followes, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no condemnation to them that be in Chriſt.</hi> This the order and cohaerence.</p>
                     <p>Now for the words; what's meant, in the firſt place,<note place="margin">Meaning of the words.</note> by Condemnation? Here we divide again. The Popiſh ſenſe is this, There is no matter condemnable, nothing worthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation in Saints. This ſenſe we cannot receive, for then it will follow that there is nothing worthy abſolution and pardon in them: Then were they free from all ſin, for ſin, as ſin, is deadly, <hi>c.</hi> 6, at leaſt free from all mortall ſin, which the ſtate and ſtory of <hi>David, Salomon, Peter,</hi> and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more do ſufficiently confute. This therefore muſt not be it, What then? The word imports a condemnatory ſentence, as <hi>Mark</hi> 10.33. and elſewhere. There is none ſuch abides the Saints, the law is diſcharged, and diſarmed of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power, as to Saints, they are removed from under it; the law borrowes its condemning ſtrength from ſin, and that's taken off as to the guilt and power of it; as the Apoſtle after ſpeaks. <hi>It is Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that juſtifies, who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne?</hi> ſo then the beleeving Saints are paſſed from death, they come not into condemnation. Some objections are made by the Jeſuits againſt this interpretation. But 'tis not worth while to dwell long upon them.</p>

The Text doth not ſay, there is no condemnation, becauſe they walk after the ſpirit; he meddles not now in the concluſion with <hi>the cauſes</hi> of Juſtification, thoſe he handles elſewhere, ſome before, ſome after, but now he is upon <hi>the ſubjects,</hi> and perſons ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and tells us in this place, not why they are juſtified, but who they be, and how qualified; or if you will, the cauſe or ground of their freedome is upon this account, becauſe they are one with Chriſt: the evidence and proof of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they live under a new guide or Law, walking not after the fleſh, but the ſpirit.

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Adams</hi> eſtate in innocency was (as we have heard) a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> very rich and glorious eſtate; he was heir of all the world, held
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102349:41"/>all of God immediately, he was in the actuall poſſeſſion of all required Graces, and had in himſelf a power of perpetu-ating his eſtate in Fee ſimple upon himſelf and his for ever: a faire eſtate, but ſhort of ours now. <hi>Adam</hi> had not <hi>the heir himſelf</hi> as we have, had not ſo near an union with God as we by Chriſt; he had a good <hi>Land-lord,</hi> but not a <hi>Father</hi> by marriage; nor had he that ſecurity and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, againſt all pretenders and claimers that we have: <hi>he</hi> held God by the hand, but <hi>God</hi> holds us.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the holy Angels in heaven, are doubtleſſe in a very good condition, their eſtate is free, glorious, ſure, yet ours in Chriſt our head, exceeds theirs.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Saints now in heaven, are in a bleſſed ſtate, and for time, have gotten the ſtart of us, yet for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the matter, we have as good, as ſure an eſtate as themſelves; the difference lies in this, they are ſeiſed of it in <hi>perſon</hi> and in <hi>part,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 2.6.</note> we in our <hi>proxy</hi> and <hi>head</hi> Chriſt, there we alſo ſit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. neither ſhall they be perfected, till we come to them; now then to cloſe this comparative conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, if our eſtate in many things exceeds <hi>Adams,</hi> in ſome things the Angels, if for the main, we hold pace with the ſoules now in bliſſe, having the ſame both heire and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, our eſtate is certainly good; <hi>Adams</hi> was good, the Angels better, the Saints beſt, and the Saints is ours for the ſubſtance of it.</p>

Hereupon it is, that our Saviour in the Goſpel, and his Apoſtles in their Doctrines and Epiſtles, drive mainly at
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102349:45"/>perſeverance in the faith once given, and call thick upon us, for perſiſting therein, for ſtanding faſt, for ſtanding out, for overcoming and continuing to the end, in this bleſſed eſtate of grace, wherein now we ſtand; and labour nothing more then to take us off, from all other Chriſts, Goſpels, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, wayes, eſtates; it is the main drift of all or moſt of the Epiſtles. For well did they ſee that a continuance was as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as an entrance; they well knew our unſteadineſſe and fickleneſſe, and how licoriſh our nature is after novelties; nor were they ignorant of Satans wiles, of perilous times to come, and therefore have they given us ſo frequent, and ſo loud warnings.

Let me tell you, all the Doctrines of later Editions drive moſtly at this, to wreſt you from this eſtate in Chriſt, and to create and eſtabliſh another title and tenure. Hence thoſe new wayes of happineſſe without Chriſt. Hence the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivall of our crackt title in <hi>Adam,</hi> hence the deniall of Chriſts purchaſe, hence the addition of joynt purchaſers with him, hence the adding of more ſtrings to our bow, and the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adding of our righteouſneſſe to Chriſts <hi>ad corroborandum,</hi> yea and the depoſiting of all the evidences and aſſurances with our ſelves. Look to your ſtanding and be true to your colours, Chriſt hath bought you to himſelf, and hath liſted you into his ſervice, betray not his right, who will never, never, never, as he ſaith <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. deſert you, if you flinch not from him: you know in whom you have beleeved, continue in the faith of Jeſus, as you have been taught the truth in him. Abide in the communion of Chriſt, in the grace of Chriſt, in the power of Chriſt, find all your hopes, joyes, life, ſafety, and ſubſiſtence in him alone, fetch all your ſtrength and life from him, nothing from any other, hold all of him, flye to no other title, aſcribe all to him, and, in a word, owe to him,

<pb facs="tcp:102349:72"/>principles, and in wayes that will mar all if they be not timely lookt to: What their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and tenents be, I am loth to make too pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, &amp; therfore rather intimated then expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them before, &amp; now do much rather deſire their buriall then their life; to that end, I ſaid ſomething to the honourable Governours and godly Citizens of this place; and doe further implore and beſeech all others who deſire the peace of the Church, the proſperity of the City, the advancement of Chriſts Kingdome, to bring ſome Buckets towards the quenching of theſe wild and unnaturall fires amongſt us; yea and above the reſt, I humbly pray thoſe of my Brethren to lend herein their hand &amp; help, who are more (as they conceive) indulgent towards them, at leaſt (as others think) moſt prevailing with them.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have in this Chapter two great doubts reſolved: the one a Souldiers, the other a Preachers; both conſult God, and he reſolves both. The Souldier was one <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> and his ſcruple was about our bleſſed Saviour, not touching his offices or his nature, <hi>(he knew that there was no other name under heaven whereby he could be ſaved)</hi> but the doubt was touching his perſon, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this <hi>particular man,</hi> which the Apoſtles cryed up, and the Phariſees cryed downe, whether he were <hi>that</hi> Chriſt, <hi>that</hi> Saviour, yea or no: This was the doubt, and this doubt ſends him unto God in a way of prayer, and God ſends him unto <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> for information: <hi>Peter (the ſecond perſon)</hi> is not without his ſcruple alſo; his doubt was, with what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant he might go to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (ſuch <hi>Cornelius</hi> was) &amp; preach

Then he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers where he was <hi>(in his houſe.)</hi> 3. he remembers what he was then doing, he was then <hi>(praying.)</hi> 4. he remembers what time of the day it was <hi>(the ninth houre of the day.)</hi> 5. he remembers the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> that was ſent, he came in the <hi>ſhape</hi> of <hi>a man,</hi> though he were an <hi>Angel,</hi> and <hi>(in bright ſhining apparell)</hi> 6. he remembers the meſſage what it was, and what the direction: 1. he calls him by name, and next he wiſhes him to go to ſuch a place <hi>(Joppa)</hi> there to enquire for one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>(Simon)</hi> this <hi>Simon</hi> lay at another <hi>(Simon's houſe)</hi> that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was <hi>(a Tanner)</hi> he lived by the <hi>(Sea-ſide;)</hi> all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were delivered to <hi>Cornelius;</hi> ſo that as certainly as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was <hi>Peter,</hi> and he <hi>Cornelius,</hi> ſo ſure it is that there could be no colluſion or miſtake in this buſineſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he concludes, that <hi>Peter</hi> had a warrant to come, and he a warrant to ſend, and therefore now nothing hindred, but that they might fall on to their work; this is <hi>Cornelius his account</hi> of himſelfe; we will ſtay at this time in this account of his, and in this verſe which we have propounded to you, where we have theſe particulars obſervable.</p>

And here it is not my meaning to enter into thoſe vaſt common places of Prayer, and of Almeſ-deeds; we have had occaſion even in this City to ſpeak, divers yeers ſince, in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102349:76"/>another place to theſe heads; we are now to ſpeak another way, and to conſider theſe things as they lye here in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> made by <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and as they carry with them Gods anſwer to the one, Gods reſpect to the other.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We will begin with his Prayer, next we will ſpeak of his Almes, rather of <hi>the ſucceſſe of both;</hi> and then in the third place, we will ſay ſomewh at of his <hi>perſon,</hi> when we have ſpoken of his actions, if time and ſtrength will give.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We beſeech you to take notice of the unſpeakable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; <hi>gractouſneſſe</hi> of God towards poore <hi>ſuppliants</hi> in point of <hi>prayer,</hi>

                     </note> for that is the thing we muſt grow to; and for this, conſider the grounds in the Text, conſider the perſon now in queſtion, <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a poore man, was in a very great ſtreight, faine he would pleaſe God, faine he would ſave his ſoule; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe could be done without a Chriſt, and Chriſt muſt now be beleeved in, in a <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>cloſer</hi> way then before; it is not enough for him to beleeve, <hi>Christum,</hi> or in <hi>Christe,</hi> but he muſt beleeve that this is <hi>the very Chriſt,</hi> that this is the man and none elſe. Now here ſticks the doubt; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors were mightily divided about this point; the Phariſees and thoſe happily that had been meanes of his converſion from heatheniſme to Judaiſme, they were altogether againſt Chriſt, and looked upon him, and reported him as a ſeducer. On the other ſide, a few unlearned men they ſtood for him, and they preached that there was no other way to ſalvation but in and through this <hi>crucified</hi> perſon; in this caſe, what ſhould poore <hi>Cornelius</hi> doe more then what he did? namely, to betake himſelfe to God in way of prayer, and to deſire di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from him in this his doubt; and thus he does, and you ſee with what <hi>ſucceſſe</hi> he does it, how <hi>graciouſly</hi> the Lord does condeſcend and anſwer him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Lord does heare him, nay, he does heare him <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,</hi> for that is the force of the word here uſed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound in our Text,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note>

                  <p>God did heare him to purpoſe, I ſay, heard him graciouſly; and not onely ſo, 2. but he does ſend him <hi>word</hi> that he heard him, and ſent him word too 3. by an <hi>Angel,</hi> and gives him 4. to underſtand, how that his prayer and all his ſervices
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102349:76"/>are <hi>accepted</hi> of God. Oh! what a comfort was this to a poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed ſoul, to have ſo punctuall, ſo direct an anſwer ſent him from heaven unto his prayer, and unto his ſcruples! but thus deales God with his Childeen, never more kind unto his, then when they come unto him begging; then when men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be ſhye and ſtrange, and to ſtand off, and to hold off at a diſtance, <hi>tken</hi> is God moſt free, moſt open, moſt gracious unto his people; this we ſee in this <hi>Cornelous</hi> here; <q>goe (ſayes God) when he had prayed; goe, ſayes God unto an Angel, commend me to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> tell him from me, that he is more in my bookes then he is aware of; I take notice of his <hi>name,</hi> I take notice of his <hi>prayer,</hi> I take notice of every <hi>Almeſ deed</hi> that he does beſtow upon my people, I obſerve all theſe things, yea, I record them, and they ever live and ſtand good <hi>before me:</hi> what could be ſaid more to the encouragement of a poore ſuppliant?</q> thus God deales with <hi>Cornelius:</hi> And thus, you know, he dealt with <hi>Daniel;</hi> the caſe is much what alike, in the 9. of <hi>Dan.</hi> 20. and ſo forward; you ſhall read <hi>Daniels ſucceſſe</hi> upon his prayer, he prayed for the people of God; and how ſpeeds he? very well: Obſerve the circumſtances in the Text, the time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> when God does anſwer him, even <hi>whilſt he was praying,</hi> ſayes the Text; nay (ſayes the holy Ghoſt there) even at the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> at the firſt ſetting out of his petition, the anſwer, the grant was ſealed, and his petition accepted, God did yeeld unto the ſame at the very entrance; he could no ſooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſpeak, but God reſolves of a word of comfort and grace to him. Conſider another circumſtance, and that is, the Meſſenger that God ſends to him, he diſpatches an Angel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>Gabriel,</hi> that earſt had been with him (it ſeems) upon other occaſions, he comes to him with a <hi>Meſſage,</hi> and he tels him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that he is accepted of God; the greeting is this; O <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, greatly beloved;</hi> O <hi>Daniel</hi> the great favourite of heaven, underſtand that the great God takes notice of thee, and he writes thy petitions, and hath ſent me to returne his anſwer unto thy ſuite; and the anſwer is very full and very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſatisfying; he grants him what he did deſire, he tels him of <hi>more</hi> then <hi>Daniel</hi> did put into his petition; ſo gracious is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102349:77"/>God unto his people when they ſue unto him in this way of prayer: What ſhould I inſtance <hi>Abraham</hi> now? what ſhould I ſpeak of <hi>Jacob,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Hannah,</hi> of <hi>Jonah,</hi> of other particulars in this caſe? I'le conclude with one, <hi>Paul,</hi> and I'le but touch upon it: in the Chapter before my Text at the 11. verſe, you ſhall read bow God deales with this ſame <hi>Paul; Paul (alias Saul)</hi> was ſometime very rough and boiſtrous, breathed out nothing but blood and threats; then God deals with him in a rougher way: but now <hi>Paul</hi> is on his knees, and mark what followes, preſently the Lord diſpatches one <hi>Ananias</hi> unto him; <q>
                        <hi>Ananias</hi> (ſayes he) goe to <hi>Paul,</hi> thou ſhalt find him in ſuch a <hi>place,</hi> thou ſhalt have him there at his prayers, goe to him, tell him from me, that he is a choyce, a precious Veſſell in my eyes, and in my eſteem, let him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſo much from me;</q> 
                     <hi>Ananias,</hi> he begins to ſtartle; Oh Lord! (ſayes he) this man hath been a perſecutor, and he came hither for to doe miſchiefe, I am afraid to come at him: tuſh (ſayes God) be not ſo ſhye of him now; be not ſo ſhye, deliver to him from me a meſſage, and a word of grace and comfort; and why? for (ſayes God) <hi>he prayes,</hi> he prayes (ſayes God) that is the reaſon of it; now <hi>Paul</hi> is a <hi>praying Paul;</hi> the caſe is altered; it is a time of his <hi>praying,</hi> and therefore it is a time of my <hi>pittying,</hi> and of my mercy; now he prayes, I accept of him, doe thou accept of him; and ſo <hi>Ananias</hi> does, for he goes to him, and preſently ſalutes him; <hi>Brother Saul</hi> (ſayes he;) when he is Gods <hi>child,</hi> he is his <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſtreight, all quarrels are laid downe aſſoon as ever <hi>Saul</hi> fals to <hi>praying;</hi> he <hi>prayes</hi> (ſayes God,) that is ſuflicient. Yon ſee how graciouſly God deales with his when they fall a praying once.</p>
                  <p>Now if you would know a reaſon of this, why God ſhewes himſelfe ſo gracious to us in the time and caſe of prayer; the reaſon is not from any <hi>worth</hi> of our perſons, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ </seg>1</label> or of our prayers, in themſelves conſidered for alas! what are they in the ſight of God? or what need hath he of any ſervice from us at all? you know in the law the burning and broyling of ſo many beaſts, eſpecially with hides and all (as ſometime it fell out) was a thing that yeelded no ſavour of reſt at all in it ſelfe:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102349:77"/>what could come from this, but a filthy ſmoak, a filchy ſrench? but then there was added thereto wine &amp; oyle, and incenſe of Gods appointment, and ſo it was Gods Ordinance, and then there was a ſavour of reſt in it: Think the ſame for our prayers too, as they come from us, and are onely ours; there's nothing in them of worth or acceptance: But when Gods Spirit is in it, when Gods incenſe, Gods perfume is put to it, with his bleſſing upon his owne way and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, then they come to be accepted, not (I ſay) ſimply, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ours, but becauſe they are Gods;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </note> God goes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne motives, he graces and reſpects our prayers; but why? becauſe he loves prayers as <hi>his owne;</hi> and the party pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as his <hi>owne;</hi> and becauſe he delights in mercy prayed for, and for other reaſons that we ſhall give you by and by.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, God, he does love prayer, <hi>Pro.</hi> 15.8. They pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the righteous is his delight; it is Gods muſick, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation; it is called incenſe, in this reſpect it is pleaſing and acceptable unto God, prayer is his delight, becauſe that it is his own appointment and Ordinance, and that Ordinance that ſets God in the Throne(if I may ſo ſpeak)I meane that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him as God unto his people; for we never give unto God the glory of himſelfe untill ſuch time as we fall a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but prayer gives away <hi>all</hi> from the creature, it carries <hi>all</hi> to God; and ſo ſets up God, and therefore God is pleaſed with prayer, and delights in the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And then againe, God loves the party praying (we ſpeak of Gods children that doe pray) I ſay, he loves the party <hi>praying</hi> too; and when the perſon is accepted, then you know any thing, paſſes very well; let that Damoſell, in <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.22. pleaſe <hi>Herod,</hi> though in a toy, you know what <hi>Herod</hi> ſayes to her ſtraight, aske what thou wilt (ſayes he) it ſhall be given unto thee; let <hi>Esther</hi> pleaſe <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> and then ſhee need not wooe him, he will wooe her; ſpeak (ſayes he) O Queen <hi>Esther,</hi> what is thy petition, and what is thy requeſt? and it ſhall be granted unto thee. God delights in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his children, he loves them dearly; and becauſe they are ſo precious in his eyes, their prayers and their entreaties are very welcome to him, <hi>John</hi> 16.25.</p>

                  <p> Thirdly, God is a God that delights in merey, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tels us; <hi>he delights in meroy,</hi> ſayes <hi>Jeremy;</hi> and,<note place="margin">Jer. 9.24. Mieah 7.18.</note> ſayes <hi>Micah, morcy pleaſes him:</hi> God is very well pleaſed when he hath an <hi>opportunity</hi> to ſhew his bounty, and to exerciſe his mercy, and his graciouſneſſe towards his people (and when he finds them on their knees, then they are in a capacity of mercy:) God is pleaſed with this, even to ſcatter mercy, and to ſnew himſelfe a bountifull God, he delights herein, therefore does even <hi>heap</hi> mercy upon his people when they are capable of the ſame: <hi>Hitherto,</hi> ſayes Chriſt in the 16. of John 24. <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto you have asked nothing in my name, aske and you ſhall receive. Nothing,</hi> that is, nothing to ſpeak of, as if he would ſay, nothing that I value at any thing, I doe not ſatisfie my ſelfe in that which I have done for you hitherto, you have hitherto asked nothing to ſpeak of, aske more, I am ready to give you more; ſo large are his bowels and his favours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people; God ſtands diſpoſed to his when they come asking, as <hi>Naaman</hi> ſometimes did, <hi>2 King. 5.</hi> toward <hi>Gehezi; Gehezi</hi> comes to aske one talent, and one ſuit of raiment for each Levite (that he ſuggeſts and ſues for;) but what ſayes <hi>Naaman</hi> to him? nay, take two; one is too little, take two, and the Text tels us that he did <hi>preſſe him,</hi> and heaps them upon him: So deales God with his people when they come to him for mercy and for kindneſſe; nay (ſayes God) take more, or at leaſt, I would you were capable of more, I could as willingly give it, as you are willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, if the ſtay were not on your owne part: God loves mercy, and therefore is ready to entertaine the prayers of his children when they come for mercy. As there are theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons taken from Gods gracious and bleſſed <hi>nature,</hi> ſo others may be added from other occaſions.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, from the engagements that lye upon God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his free and gracious promiſes; promiſes very <hi>free</hi> and very <hi>large,</hi> both for the <hi>matter</hi> that we ſhall ask; ask what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you will,<note place="margin">John 14.13. Pſal. 81.10.</note> ask in my name (ſayes Chriſt) you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it: as alſo for the <hi>meaſure,</hi> open thy mouth wide (ſayes God) and I will fill it: as alſo for the <hi>time</hi> when God will doe it, <hi>before you ſpeak I will heare, and while you are ſpeaking
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102349:78"/>I will anſwer,</hi> in the 65. of <hi>Iſatab.</hi> I forbeare to name other places, becauſe they are familiarly knowne to you, ſo that God having engaged himſelf by promiſe to doe great things,<note place="margin">Iſa. 30.19.</note> and (as he ſayes in the Prophet) to be <hi>very gracious</hi> unto his people in point of prayer, therefore certainly he will be as good as his word.</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all, (which is the maine reaſon of all in truth) the reaſon is from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and from that <hi>Covenant</hi> and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction that paſſes between: <hi>breſt</hi> and his Father: Chriſt, he preſents our prayers, nay, we preſent Chriſt unto his Father; God looks upon a Chriſtian as a piece and a <hi>member</hi> of Chriſt, he looks upon his prayer, as the <hi>fruit</hi> of Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerceſſion and Prieſtdome; our prayers (being Saints) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited by Chriſts <hi>Spirit,</hi> and are preſented by Chriſts <hi>hand</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Father; they are perfumed with his interceſſion, and with his incenſe,<note place="margin">Revel. 3.4.</note> and therefore it is certaine they be very pleaſing to God: God for Chriſts ſake will deny none that come in the name and in the Spirit of the Lord Chriſt; nay, God hath left the whole <hi>dispenſation</hi> of this buſineſſe unto the Lord Chriſt, and hath referred all to him, even to doe what he will with the Saints in the Church, as ſometimes <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> did with <hi>Eſther,</hi> left it to her what ſhe would have done for her people and againſt her enemies; and as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Pharach</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joſeph, Joſeph</hi> (ſayes he) thy brethren are come into <hi>AEgypt</hi> unto thee, bid them welcome, take the Land at thy command, place them where thou thinkeſt good; ſo unto the ſame effect does God ſay unto the Lord Chriſt, <q>here be friends of thine, members of thine, that are bone of thy bone, fleſh of thy fleſh, they come to me for ſome reliefe and ſuccour in thy name, here they be, receive them, take them, doe for them what thou ſeeſt good, I will ratifle it, I will make it good;</q> this is the maine reaſon: And theſe are the reaſons which I ſhall give you of the point, why the Lord is ſo gracious unto his poore ſervants, when they come a begging and a ſuing unto him. Now give me leave in a few words to bring home this point, and to apply it, and then we will paſſe to another.</p>

Conſider of it I beſeech you, 1. What a long journey we muſt take; and then, how long we muſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102349:79"/>wait: and then, how uncertaine we ſhould be of any ſucceſſe or gracious anſwer at all: Weigh theſe things with your ſelves, and then reflect upon Gods goodneſſe, and admire him for the ſame: I inlarge it a little further: A man hath a ſuit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an earthly King or Prince, and what muſt he do? Firſt of all he muſt take a long journey to the Kings Court; and then when he is there, he muſt find out ſome Courtiers, ſome friends to ſpeak for him, and to make way for him, that he may have acceſſe; when that is done, he muſt wait the Kings leiſure, early and late he muſt be ready to wait, and ſo ſtay his lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and his pleaſure: When this is done, that he hath got acceſſe once, and is brought into the Kings preſence, how then? he is not permitted to ſpeak his heart unto the King, and to ſay at large what his griefe and his affliction is; nay, he muſt not ſpeak at all, onely deliver his Petition, and that he muſt have ready drawne, and fairly drawne, there muſt be no blurre in it, very briefe it muſt be, and very ſuccinct, he muſt not ſpeak any thing in the world that is impertinent, or that would be diſpleaſing, but carry it ſo, as that he may give full content: And when all this is done, and his Petition is received, he hath not preſently an anſwer, but he muſt wait and wait againe, he muſt follow the Court into this place, and that place; and when anſwer does come, it may be it is but halfe an anſwer and a grant, perhaps the anſwer is none other but a bare deniall, at leaſt a man cannot build upon it, becauſe he hath no promiſe before-hand that he ſhall be accepted, and that his petition ſhall be granted: Thus it is when we deale with an earthly Prince, when we come but upon one Petition: But now put the caſe that this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be granted, what is it? it is but for ſome partiall or ſome particular thing; 'tis not a grant that will make me happy, and that will doe my ſoule any good at all, I ſhall need more things; and what if I need againe, muſt I to the Court again? muſt I wait againe? muſt I run the ſame round I ran before? Oh how troubleſome, how coſtly, how tedious would this be unto me?

                        <hi>3.</hi> Future.</note> and it teaches us a third thing, and then we have done with the firſt part: The thing is this: Sith God is ſo gracious towards his people in point of prayer, therefore we ſhould be invited <hi>now,</hi> and encouraged to make uſe of this his kindneſſe, and to goe to him upon this errand of prayer, as need ſhall require: Let us, I beſeech you, think as meanly of our ſelves, and of our ſervices as you will; but let us alwayes have high thoughts of God, and when we come to him in his owne way, then promiſe great things to our ſelves: And know, that he is able and ready to doe abundantly above that we can ſpeak or think (as the Apoſtle tels us;) thus we ſhould goe to God,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.</note> and of his goodneſſe herein we have a great deale of experience; if we will not beleeve the <hi>promiſes</hi> that are very gracious, yet let us beleeve our owne <hi>experience</hi> this way to truſt in him: hath not God been gracious <hi>to us</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> hath not God been gracious to us in <hi>common,</hi> for the publike, when we have ſought unto him in this way of prayer? If ſo, then let us conclude, that God is a conſtant God, his power as great as loves prayer as well as ever he did; he loves <hi>Chriſt</hi> as well as ever he did, who is our Mediator; and he loves the <hi>perſons</hi> of the Elect as much as ever he did; he delights in <hi>mercy</hi> as much as ever; therefore let this encourage us to goe to God in all our afflictions and diſtreſſes, whether they are <hi>perſonall,</hi> or whether they are <hi>publike.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For our perſonall defects, and our perſonall diſtreſſes, let us goe to God as <hi>Cornelius,</hi> here does; <hi>Cornelius,</hi> he is in a ſtreight, and it was in a point of great concernment, he muſt reſolve one way or other, off or on; either be for this Chriſt, or againſt him; <hi>Cornelius</hi> knew not which way to reſolve, he prayes therefore, he deſires God that he would <hi>enlighten</hi> him, that he would direct him: Oh! let us doe the like in theſe diſtreſſed times, when there be ſuch diviſions and diſtractions in the Church of God, and amongſt the people of God, that a poore ſimple body knowes not what is right, and what is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102349:81"/>truth, and what is not; knowes not which ſide to adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: Some call him this way, and ſome call him that way; and another ſayes this is right, and you muſt goe this way if ever you will be ſaved; and another ſpeaks quite to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: What now ſhould a poore man doe? Doe as <hi>Cornelius</hi> did, goe unto God alone, pray, faſt, importune him, deſire him that he will teach thee, that he will <hi>reſolve</hi> thee, deſire him that he would ſend ſome <hi>Peter</hi> to thee, ſome Preacher, ſome Divine or other, that may ſettle thee and confirme thee in the way that thou ſhouldſt goe: Thus if we doe, God will be the ſame to us that he was unto <hi>Cornelius,</hi> God heard him, and God will heare us too, though he doe not ſend an Angel from Heaven as he did to him, yet he will ſend ſome <hi>Peter,</hi> he will ſend ſome direction whereby we ſhall receive ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, at leaſt for thoſe things that are <hi>ſimply neceſſary</hi> and fundamentall; he will diſcover ſo much unto us, as ſhall be <hi>accepted,</hi> and as ſhall guide us unto his Heavens: This is his promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. he will guide the meek in his way, and he will teach ſinners the way, and he will ſhew unto them his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and in <hi>John</hi> 7.17. ſayes our Saviour, <hi>He that will doe the will of God, he ſhall know the doctrine whether it be of God or no:</hi> If a man in <hi>humility</hi> of ſpirit, and in <hi>ſincerity</hi> and truth of heart will goe to God for direction, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> did, reſolving with him, I and mine are here before God, and <hi>whatſoever</hi> God ſhall ſpeak unto us in his <hi>ministery,</hi> we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to doe it, and to follow it: If any man will doe thus, it is certaine that God will give him a reſolution and a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuch a ſettlement as ſhall be acceptable (as we ſaid before) and ſhall give ſatisfaction to his ſoule. What I ſpeak of this particular (becauſe the very caſe leads me to it, in my Text) that'we may ſay of all other things too: Carry <hi>all</hi> thy feares to God, and <hi>all</hi> thy ſorrowes to God, and <hi>all</hi> thy ſcruples to God, acquaint him with thy caſe, and beg help and ſtrength from him, he is able, he is ready to heare. Yea but will he heare <hi>(me?)</hi> Yea <hi>thee,</hi> he will heare <hi>thee.</hi> Oh! but my prayers are weak, and poore: He is a gracious God, he paſſes by infirmities, doe what thou art able to doe, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102349:81"/>he is as ready to help thee as <hi>Cornelius.</hi> 2. What we ſay for <hi>private</hi> men, that we may ſay much more now, in the <hi>publike</hi> Caſe, when it comes to publike prayer, and to matter of a publike concernment, here we ſhould be encouraged to goe to God: Is God ſo ready to heare prayer? does he ſo graciouſly anſwer and accept of poore and weak prayer? Then, I beſeech you, why ſhould not we goe to God in reſpect of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Church,</hi> and in reſpect of the preſent <hi>condition</hi> that we lye under now? Oh! let us all ſet a praying; pray home the King, pray downe Antichriſt, pray up the Lord Chriſt into his Throne, pray againſt the ſinnes of the Land, that they may be removed, and all thoſe <hi>obstructions</hi> that doe hinder the ſucceſſe of our prayers from day to day; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there are very ſtrange and <hi>great</hi> obſtructions that lye in the way, otherwiſe it were not poſſible for our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God that is ſo ready to heare the Petitions of <hi>one</hi> poore man, to ſtand out ſo long againſt the ſuits and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of <hi>all</hi> the people in a whole <hi>Nation;</hi> the obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are great, pray all theſe out of the way.

                  <p>One maine thing which probably hinders our ſucceſſes in prayer is the <hi>blood</hi> that lyes upon the Land,<note place="margin">Obstructions in prayer, and its ſucceſſe.</note> that is a heavy thing, that lyes heavy upon the heart of the Land.

Oh! this ſinne, this ſinne threatens this Land of ours! this blood that lyes upon the Land, the blood that was ſhed heretofore in the dayes of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> that innocent blood that hath been ſhed ſince by this unhappy difference that is amongſt us: Oh! the Sea of blood that runs through this Land; who muſt be <hi>responſall,</hi> who muſt be anſwerable for this? this is a great ſinne that obſtructs our prayers much.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102349:82"/>there was innocent blood ſhed, and the murderer could not be found out, then the neighbouring Townes they muſt goe forth, they muſt ſlay a Beaſt, offer a Sacrifice, waſh their hands, pray to God; Oh Lord! be mercifull unto the Land, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Cities, lay not to our charge this blood: So muſt we doe in this caſe; Oh Lord, be mercifull unto this poore Land almoſt drowned in blood, doe not charge upon us this blood, lay not to our charge this innocent blood, but accept of a Sacrifice, and an atonement: That is one thing we muſt pray againſt, as a maine obſtruction.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And then thirdly; there is a third obſtruction, and that is the fearfull indiſpoſition to <hi>peace</hi> that is amongſt us, and an aptneſſe to quarrell and fall out within our ſelves; I ſpeak not onely of that outward warre that is abroad, but I ſpeak of another buſineſſe within our ſelves; if God would put up his ſword, it is a queſtion whether we would put up ours, yea or no: I am afraid of a <hi>ſacred</hi> warre, if the civill warre were once ended and determined; many ſpirits are ſo imbittered one againſt another, men are ſo inchanted with their owne

                  <p>But laſt of all, there is another, and that ſummes up all; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and that is our unworthy <hi>carriage towards</hi> God in the midſt of ſo many meanes and mercies: He hath given us his <hi>Word,</hi> we <hi>ſleight</hi> that; he hath made a <hi>Covenant</hi> with us, and we have renewed the Seale thereof, many of us (I doubt not) of late: this Covenant we falſifie, we prophane and abuſe; the Lord hath executed <hi>ſome judgements</hi> amongſt us, and what uſe doe we make of them? where is the man (almoſt) that is one whit reformed, or much the better for all theſe miſeries and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities that have come upon the State, and upon the Land? this, this is <hi>the ſinne,</hi> the provoking ſinne, that we are too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to incorrigible this way, and tooto backward to improve thoſe meanes and thoſe judgements which are amongſt us: For this God might juſtly have a controverſie with the Land; Oh! let us pray, let us pray, that we may be of one mind, and of one judgement, that ſo there may be peace in our Land, peace in our Churches, peace in our worſhips, that we doe not fight againſt our ſelves in our prayers: And let us pray in the next place, that we may make better uſe of the Word, and of the miniſtery thereof; that we may make better uſe of former corrections, and former judgements then we have done, that ſo the Lord at length may look upon us, and when we are humbled and doe accept of his puniſhment, may then remember the Land, our diſtreſſed Land, our reeling Land, our dying Land, that God in mercy may then think upon it, and heale it: Thus we ſhould labour, even to pray unto God for the publike, that all hinderances may be removed, and all furtherances expedited, whereby our happineſſe may be recovered and reſetled: And why ſhould we not ſet upon this work now? what reaſon have we to be diſmaid? <label type="milestone">

So that that cannot be the reaſon why God reſpects our mercy, for any worth or dignity that is in our Almes: But the reaſon is this; God is pleaſed in Chriſt to look upon our <hi>perſons,</hi> and then next to accept of our <hi>ſervices</hi> for Chriſts ſake;<note place="margin">Reaſons.</note>

                  <p>If this be ſo, that God takes <hi>particular notice,</hi> and writes downe every work of mercy that is done; then this ſpeakes but ſad newes unto divers ſorts of people.</p>
                  <p>The firſt are ſuch men as are meere <hi>ſtrangers unto mercy,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and the fruits thereof; they were never guilty of ſuch a thing as Mercy and Almeſ-deeds: If you compare the Books (Gods and theirs) together, you ſhall find the Books much what alike unto ſome <hi>Almanacks,</hi> that are full of letters, both red and black &amp; bloody on one ſide, but on the other ſide there is fair paper, a waſte empty blank, that is all that is to be found there: Even ſo it is with many a mans books, if he be a true recorder of his works of mercy: On the one ſide, you ſhall find, <hi>Item,</hi> ſo much ſpent upon <hi>Pride,</hi> and ſo much ſpent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Luſt,</hi> and ſo much ſpent upon <hi>Revenge,</hi> and ſo much ſpent at <hi>Dice,</hi> and ſo much ſpent in <hi>Playes,</hi> and ſo much ſpent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>ſinne</hi> and Wickedneſſe; this ſide is full of what hath been laid out touching themſelves, and for themſelves in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of their luſts: But now when it comes to a work of mercy, what have you done <hi>for God?</hi> what for <hi>Chriſt?</hi> what for the <hi>members</hi> of Chriſt? what for the advancement of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi> or any <hi>pious</hi> work or ſervice? what ſhall you find there? Even a blank, meere cyphers, nothing elſe. Oh mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable men! how will theſe fare when they ſhall be called to an accompt for their <hi>Stewardſhip?</hi> when they have laid out all for themſelves, and upon themſelves and their luſts, and laid out nothing at all for <hi>God,</hi> and for the love of God. This is one ſort.</p>
                  <p>But then there is another ſort worſe then theſe, and they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſuch as are not onely ſtrangers unto mercy, but are <hi>Oppoſites, Enemies,</hi> (as it were) to mercy; at loaſt they walk in a quite oppoſite way unto the way of mercy: Theſe, why theſe do not <hi>feed</hi> the poor, but they <hi>flay</hi> them; they do not <hi>cloath</hi> them, but they <hi>ſtrip</hi> them; they make not any <hi>proviſion</hi> for them, but caſt how utterly to <hi>ruine</hi> and to <hi>undoe</hi> them: In ſtead of <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> them they <hi>wound</hi> them; in ſtead of <hi>relieving</hi> them, they <hi>oppreſſe</hi> them, and in ſtead of being to them any <hi>eaſe</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102349:85"/>comfort, they lay upon them <hi>heavy burdens,</hi> heavy preſſures: This is a black crying ſinne, and will prove ſo at the <hi>laſt</hi> day; what? if they in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> well inferres thence) if they ſhall be ſhut <hi>out</hi> of Heaven, and ſeat from the <hi>preſence</hi> of God with a curſe, who have not <hi>fed</hi> the hungry, nor <hi>cloathed</hi> the naked, nor <hi>viſited</hi> the impriſoned? &amp;c. Oh then: where ſhall they appeare? and what ſhall become of them that are ſo farre from this, that they have done what they could to <hi>ſsuck</hi> out the very blood of the poor members of Jeſus Chriſt! This is a ſecond ſort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Nay, in the third place, let this be a matter of humbling to the <hi>beſt</hi> of us, for certainly we are all ſhort in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and have cauſe even to bluſh and hang downe our heads, betwixt <hi>man and man</hi> when it comes to a <hi>contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,</hi> and we ſee other men underwrite, it may be, ſo many <hi>crownes,</hi> or ſo many <hi>pounds,</hi> we are aſhamed to appeare in the ſame Roll, and to have our names liſted where <hi>farthings</hi> and <hi>half-pence</hi> are ſet upon our heads; much more ſhould we bluſh when we bring our ſelves into the preſence of <hi>God,</hi> and there conſider that God ſees all <hi>we</hi> doe, all that <hi>others</hi> have done; he writes downe every mans <hi>name,</hi> every mans <hi>worke,</hi> every mans <hi>Almes,</hi> and they are <hi>bookt,</hi> and this book will be read and produced at the laſt day: This, this ſhould put us to the bluſh, eſpecially when we conſider two things yet found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> us: That is, our <hi>backwardneſſe</hi> unto works of mercy; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> our <hi>barrenneſſe</hi> in works of mercy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, for our <hi>backwardneſſe;</hi> how heavily doe we come off (for the moſt part) in works of this kind? <hi>Mercy</hi> is by our Saviour preferred before <hi>kindneſſe:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 14.13.</note> Sayes he, when thou makeſt a Feaſt, bid the poore, &amp;c. doe not bid the rich; a man may bid his rich friends in a way of <hi>kindneſſe,</hi> but (ſayes Chriſt) preferre the other before that, <hi>mercy</hi> before <hi>kindneſſe,</hi> mercy is better then kindneſſe. But now (my Brethren) is it ſo with us? doe we ſet <hi>mercy</hi> above <hi>kindneſſe?</hi> in way of kindneſſe and neighbourhood, you know what men will doe; a friend deſires you to goe a journey with him, you will goe; you will ſay, what though it coſt me <hi>five pound?</hi> what
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102349:85"/>if it be <hi>ten pound?</hi> what a matter is that betwixt friend and friend, neighbour and neighbour? When you meet together (ſometimes) in a Taverne, or at an Inne upon ſome occaſions in way of <hi>kindneſſe,</hi> to drink or feaſt together, then happy is that man that can be rid of his money firſt; I'le pay ſayes one; I'le pay ſayes the other; you ſhall not pay a penny ſayes the third, I'le beare all, &amp;c. and now happy is the man that can be rid of his money <hi>quickly;</hi> it growes ſometimes very neer to a <hi>quarrell,</hi> becauſe we cannot be ſuffered to ſpend our money: Thus in works of <hi>kindneſſe.</hi> But now come to a work of <hi>Mercy,</hi> how is it then? is the money <hi>then</hi> upon the Table? is every man ready to throw downe <hi>then,</hi> and to lead the way unto other men in this caſe? Nay then, alas! I am in debt; then, my purſe is not about me; or elſe, when it comes to the opening of the purſe, every finger is a thumb, and it is ſuch a while before any thing will be got out, that it is very tedious and irkſome to a man to behold it: Then the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not, who ſhall be <hi>firſt?</hi> but, who ſhall be <hi>last?</hi> I'le ſee what my betters doe firſt, there are ſuch and ſuch, they are a great deale richer and better then my ſelfe, I will ſee what they doe; happy is the man here that can be <hi>hindmost:</hi> Oh! my Brethren, is not this a thing, think you, that ſhould hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us, that ſhould ſhame us? that we in way of <hi>courteſie</hi> to man ſhould be thus <hi>free,</hi> but when it comes to works of <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> for God, we ſhould be ſo <hi>bound up,</hi> that we cannot cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, almoſt, part with any thing? this is one of the things we fault in our ſelves, this ſame <hi>backwardneſſe</hi> to workes of this kind.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, there is another thing, and that is <hi>barrenneſſe</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in works of mercy: If a man will but compare what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on <hi>ſelfe,</hi> and on the <hi>publike;</hi> what a vaſt difference will there appeare upon the very firſt view? If a man read his books, he ſhall find, <hi>Item</hi> ſo much beſtowed upon <hi>Apparrell,</hi> and ſo much beſtowed upon a <hi>Feast,</hi> and ſo much for <hi>my ſelfe,</hi> my <hi>ſelf credit,</hi> and my <hi>ſelf delight</hi> and <hi>content,</hi> my <hi>ſelfe I know</hi> not what, ſo much for <hi>ſelfe;</hi> there it amounts to ſcores, to <hi>hundreds,</hi> it may be, to <hi>thouſands:</hi> But then come on the other
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102349:86"/>ſide; how much for <hi>Gods Houſe?</hi> how much for <hi>Gods worſhip?</hi> how much for charitable and for <hi>mercifull uſes?</hi> and then there come <hi>two-pences</hi> and <hi>three-pences,</hi> and poore ſhort reckonings, not worthy to be accounted and ſummed up almoſt: Is it not thus (I beſeech you) with many of us? are we not thus <hi>barren</hi> in works of mercy? and ſhould not this ſhame us now? I hope, my Brethren, I hope, that there are none of you but will beare me <hi>company</hi> in this work, even this night before you ſleep, betwixt God and your ſelves to confeſſe this your ſinne, your <hi>nigardize</hi> towards God, your <hi>pinching</hi> when it comes to a work of mercy and charity; whereas you can be <hi>profuſe</hi> and <hi>prodigall</hi> when it is to ſerve your ſelves, and your owne ends.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all; <label type="milestone">

And now we have done with the two <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Cornelius;</hi> we heare what he was in point of <hi>Prayer,</hi> we heare what he was in point of <hi>Almes</hi> too: I perceive the time hath deceived me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will but touch upon the third point: I crave your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſo long.</p>
                  <p>We have ſpoken of the things ſelves; here is yet ſomething that would be ſaid of the <hi>Perſon,</hi> that is, <hi>Cornelius;</hi> he was a <hi>Gentile,</hi> and (as it ſhould ſeem) none of the beſt of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles neither, an <hi>Italian,</hi> his <hi>Name,</hi> his <hi>Band,</hi> and <hi>Hoſt</hi> ſpeak that way ſomewhat.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Cornelius</hi> was alſo a <hi>Souldier,</hi> and amongſt Souldiers an <hi>Officer;</hi> and yet notwithſtanding, you ſee, that he was a <hi>praying</hi> man, a very <hi>godly,</hi> a very devout, a very <hi>mercifull</hi> man.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:102349:90"/>
                  <p> The thing that hence we had thought to have obſerved, is this: That there is no <hi>outward</hi> diſadvantages that can <hi>excuſe</hi> us from Gods <hi>ſervice,</hi> or <hi>exempt</hi> us from Gods <hi>acceptance;</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                     </label> wo will put in both: He <hi>ſerved</hi> God, and he is <hi>accepted</hi> of God, notwithſtanding his <hi>Country</hi> and his <hi>diſadvantages;</hi> ſo that let a mans <hi>Country</hi> be what it will, let his <hi>calling</hi> be what it will, let his <hi>condition</hi> be what it will, if he <hi>ſerves</hi> God, God will <hi>accept</hi> of him, and of his ſervices. We note this the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe that <hi>Peter</hi> gives us the note in the 34. verſe of this Chapter; I perceive indeed (ſayes he) that God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in every Nation he that feares God, and works righteouſneſſe, is accepted of God, let him be what he will: but I dare not ſtand to proſecute this point.</p>
                  <p>All that we will now ſay for the Application of it, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe. </seg>
                     </label> is thus much: Firſt, it takes off that lazy excuſe that is made by many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> men; they would <hi>ſerve</hi> God, and they would pray, and they would doe much, that they would, but they are not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated accordingly: there be lets and hinderances in the way; the <hi>Time</hi> ſerves not, and the <hi>Place</hi> ſerves not, and their <hi>Calling</hi> ſerves not; thus many exceptions they have againſt the ſervice and the worſhip of God. <hi>All</hi> theſe may be anſwered with <hi>one Cornelius,</hi> beſides others, if time would have given leave. We ſee that <hi>Noah</hi> and ſome others, in the worſt <hi>times,</hi> could find time to ſerve God: We ſee that ſome in <hi>Nere's houſe,</hi> and ſo in the worſt <hi>places,</hi> have found place for to ſerve God: We ſee that ſome of thoſe <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> that ſeeme to be fartheſt from Heaven and God, ſome of thoſe Callings have ſerved God: <hi>Gajus,</hi> it ſeems, was an <hi>Inne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper,</hi> yet a faithfull man; <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Souldier and a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,</hi> and yet a godly and a religious man: So that there is no <hi>place,</hi> no <hi>time</hi> no <hi>calling</hi> that can exempt us this way.</p>
                  <p>But then ſecondly, we had thought to have ſaid ſomething <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of thoſe that pretend they would ſerve God, but they feare it would not be <hi>accepted:</hi> and why not accepted? Oh! their <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> are ſo meane and poore, and their <hi>ſervices</hi> are ſo weake

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> We ſhould (in the nexe place) have called upon you all, to doe what you <hi>can</hi> in your <hi>families,</hi> ſith that there is no man <hi>excluded</hi> from Gods <hi>acceptance,</hi> or Gods <hi>ſervice;</hi> therefore have reſpect to your ſervants, even to the very, <hi>Kichin-boy;</hi> have reſpect to all that are within your compaſſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your ſelves, doe what you can to reclaime them from ſin, to bring them up in the knowledge and information of God: What knoweſt thou (ſayes the Apoſtle) beleeving man, but thou mayſt convert thy unbeleeving wife? So ſay I to you, what know you but that God may have pitty upon thy poore <hi>ſlave,</hi> thy poore <hi>apprentice,</hi> as well as upon thy ſelfe? Yea, what know you, but if you make a good <hi>choyce,</hi> and take a good <hi>courſe,</hi> and carry a good <hi>hand</hi> over them, but that <hi>Souldiers</hi> and thoſe that lye in Garriſons, and repaire to your <hi>Ports,</hi> may be godly men, religious men, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> was?</p>
                  <p>And for your ſelves, let me call upon <hi>every</hi> man this day, to haſten to Gods ſervice: You have all the <hi>advantages</hi> that may be; you live in a Land of <hi>uprightneſſe,</hi> in a Goſhen of light; you are under a <hi>Conſtellation</hi> (as it were) of ableſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,</hi> and of ableſt <hi>Minsſters;</hi> who ſhall ſerve God, if you will not, that have all theſe helps, and theſe advantages? Therefore, art thou called to repentance? Never ſay, I <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,</hi> I have <hi>no leiſure,</hi> and the like; thou mayſt have leiſure and grace, God is able to break the hardeſt heart, he is able to melt the frozeneſt heart, and to ſubdue the ſturdieſt ſpirit; and therefore ſay not, thou canſt not: Are you called to duty and ſervice? Say not, I would pray, and I would heare, and I would doe many duties to God, but I cannot, I have not leiſure, I have no <hi>time,</hi> my <hi>place</hi> will not beare it, my <hi>occaſions</hi> will not ſuffer it: Thou mightſt if thou hadſt a heart; other men in the ſame circumſtances, in as great difficulties, have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102349:92"/>ſerved God, and waited upon him: <hi>Daniel</hi> was a man <hi>full</hi> of <hi>State-buſineſſe,</hi> yet he finds his time for praying every day to God more then once or twice: Here is a Souldier in the Text, he can feare God, he can look after his Family, and he can reſtraine his Souldiers from pilſering, and plundering, and drinking, and ſwearing, he can doe it by Gods bleſſing upon his endeavours; and if he, why not others too? therefore doe not make any ſuch lazy plea: Much leſſe ſay, Oh, it will not be <hi>accepted!</hi> it will be accepted: Give but what thou canſt give, God will accept it; pray but as thou canſt pray, God will accept it; repent as thou art <hi>able</hi> to repent, and call in Gods help and aſſiſtance, God will accept it: What ſhall I ſay more to you? I am cut off, I am afraid to be too-to tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to you: And therefore I conclude abruptly; onely I have propounded unto you <hi>one</hi> Example and <hi>Patterne</hi> of mercy, preſented unto you many <hi>Objects</hi> of mercy, and of compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; now let me preſent unto you ſome more, and theſe are knowne well to your ſelves: Here is a true report, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>He that is truly ſorry for the dead, and would (if he could) revenge his death, cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be charged with the murder.</p>

                     <hi>The Time of Abner's death</hi> was almoſt as much as the <hi>thing it ſelfe. Iſraels Abner</hi> was now <hi>Rightly ſet,</hi> (his Grounds I wave, but) over he was come to <hi>David's</hi> ſide: The Sinewes of that disjoynted State were now knitting: The ſparkes of that unhappy warre now quenching. <hi>Abner</hi> had a <hi>Great Deſigne</hi> in hand, and things were likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a faire end. In the midſt of all <hi>Abner Dyes,</hi> The <hi>Buſineſſe</hi> is <hi>ſcoated: Pendent opera interrupta:</hi> Hence theſe teares in part. It was the caſe of this our <hi>Engliſh Abner.</hi> Hee had <hi>Noble deſignes,</hi> and thoughts in his head. But Alas! <hi>How ſoone doe our thoughts fall with us! Pſalme</hi> 146. Onely <hi>the thoughts, and Counſels of the only wiſe</hi>-GOD <hi>ſtand good for ever.</hi> He had another <hi>Deſigne</hi> upon this <hi>Our Abner:</hi> And, to fit him thereunto, hee ſet him to the <hi>Beſt Schoole,</hi> that ever he was in; where the <hi>Two Schoolemaſters</hi> of <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> (<hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations</hi> and <hi>Afflictions</hi>) taught him more in one yeare, than all his Bookes, wherein hee was ſo much verſt, could doe, in an age. Now <hi>Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was tranſlated into <hi>Experience.</hi> And now I wiſh, that all of his Ranke (and of mine too) had heard him <hi>Decrying the Vanitie of all Creatures, and Abaſing ſinfull fleſh</hi> before the <hi>Great</hi> GOD.</p>
                  <p>You can eaſily conceive how <hi>Full Expreſsions</hi> would bee from his <hi>owne Mouth,</hi> and how well it would become him, to <hi>Staine the pride of man.</hi>

                  <p>And laſtly, (To ſay nothing of what was ſaid under ſeale) I wiſh that all wee <hi>(Divines)</hi> had but heard his <hi>vehement expreſsions</hi> of the <hi>baſe; baſe,</hi> and more than <hi>ſlaviſh flatteries</hi> of ſome of us <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> toward the living and dead.</p>
                  <p>But why doe I flatter my ſelfe with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of <hi>Hearing</hi> and <hi>Having</hi> him, whileſt I ſpeak his words! Hee is gone from us, and hath left us no more of <hi>Himſelfe</hi> than a <hi>Sad Repreſentation:</hi> And it muſt grieve both you and mee, to have <hi>Such a Man,</hi> at <hi>Such a Time,</hi> taken from us; and to ſee ſo much reading, obſervation, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wiſedome, (I could ſay, if yet I could ſpeake it, ſo much ingenuitie, nobleneſſe, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſſe to his Friend, when upon <hi>Try all</hi> hee could <hi>Trust</hi> him: But I onely ſay, before I get off this ſad diſcourſe) <hi>So much worth, and Sufficiency,</hi> qualifying him for the Service of any State, or Prince, ſo <hi>Suddenly ſnatch't</hi> from us.</p>
